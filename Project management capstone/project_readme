Executive Summary

Project Vision: Provide a new ordering system with our customers by integrating tablets to
assist and entertain our customers while they order

Key Accomplishments: We successfully reduced table turn time by 30 minutes and reduced
checkout time to remain at one minute or less.

Lessons Learned: Kitchen processes need to be continually refined to minimize sent back
orders; continual training may be necessary to ensure fully optimized operational procedures

Next Steps: Maintain and update technology to avoid issues; provide additional training to
reach unmet metrics; continue to fully roll out tablets into other restaurant areas and locations
